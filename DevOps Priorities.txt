DevOps Priorities

1) Different developers develop their code in the local with their respective branches.
2) From Different branches code will be merged into one common branch namely as MASTER branch.
3) As of now code is in local repository, from their we need to push the code into centralized repository.
4) So, after pushing the code into the centralized repository, it gets build through automation.
5) From the automation tool we will set it as first it should be build, then test and finally deploy.
6) Once the build gets succeeded it will goto TEST environment, if not again it will goto developers team to rectify the code.
7) So, parallely all the builds will be getting saved in the binary repository.
8) And parallely code will be reviewed and tracked using the particular tool to get the better quality outputs.
9) Finally after the successive builds and test in all environments, the deployment process will takes place.
